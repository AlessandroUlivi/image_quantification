It will not be included in the measurements quantification. It will effectively define the portion of files where the analysis is done. For example, if one has a segmentation for an embryo, the cortex of an embryo, a cell etc, it is possible to use it as an ROI. It is not required that the file is binary, but it will be binarized in the process (refer to quantify_channels within multi_channels_multi_quantifications.py). If one of the files within a sample_folder has to be used as an roi_file, indicate how to unequivocally identify it in the variable ch_roi below.\n",
    "It is further possible to change the ROI-specific analysis by using files included in the sub-folders of the roi_exclude and roi_maintain folders. It is a redundant action, but it allows for complex analyses as, for example, limiting the quantification to specific parts of the files or avoiding the quantification of a structure only along an axis and at specific timepoints."

    "It is assumed that ROIs are generated on one of the files to analyse. Also, to the whole process was conceptualized for generating ROIs using Fiji/ImageJ.\n",

    "\n",
    "- If the files to analyse are 3D and the ROIs are applied identically to all the 2D frames of the \"3rd dimension\" (for example, a z-stack or timepoints of a timecourse). There are 2 possibilities.\n",
    "1) The first possibility is to generate all the ROIs on a single 2D frame and save them in a file (.roi if a single ROI or .zip if multiple ROIs). Indicate roi_3D_maintain as False (roi_3D_maintain=False). Specify the \"3rd dimension\" along which to propagate the ROIs. If the \"3rd dimension\" is identical to the analysi_axis, the variable roi_position_axis can remain None. The analysis_axis will be automatically interpreted as the axis along which to propagate the ROIs (NOTE: an error will raise if no analysis axis is provided and roi_position_axis=None). If the \"3rd dimension\" is different than the analysis_axis or the files don't have to be analysed along an axis, indicate it in the variable roi_position_axis. For example, the file to analyse is a 3D z-stack of 10 planes and each plane is a 1024*1024 pixels image. The shape is (10,1024,1024). The same ROI should be used on all the planes. The roi is drawn on the first z-plane and saved as a .roi file. I indicate roi_3D_maintain=False. I indicate roi_position_axis=0 (the position of the z dimension in the shape). If the file had to be analysed along the z-dimension, independently per each plane, because analysis_axis was already defined, I could have left roi_position_axis=None.\n",
    "2) The second possibility is to generate the ROIs, identical, in each 2D frame of the \"3rd dimension\" of the files to analyse and save the file as a .zip. Indicate roi_3D_maintain as True (roi_3D_maintain=True). Specify the \"3rd dimension\" along which to position the ROIs. If the \"3rd dimension\" is identical to the analysi_axis, the variable roi_position_axis can remain None.

For example, the file to analyse is a 3D z-stack of 15 planes and each plane is a 1024*1024 pixels image. The shape is (1024,10,1024). The same ROI should be used on all the planes. The roi is drawn, identical, on each z-plane and the collection of ROIs is saved as a .zip file. I indicate roi_3D_maintain=True. I indicate roi_position_axis=1 (the position of the z dimension in the shape).

    "Example 1. A multi-position file is analysed. There are 6 positions, each corresponding to a well of a multi-well. Per each position there is a 2D image of size 1024*1024 pixels. The shape of the file is (1024,1024,6) thus indipenent xy position are at position 2 of the file's shape. 1 round ROI (the well of the multi-well) is analysed at each position, but the shape of the ROI slightly changes at each position. The measurement is done globally, thus the results of the ROI are all pooled together and no analysis_axis is required. I open the file as a stack in ImageJ. I define an ROI at each 2D plane, and I save the collection of ROIs as a .zip file. I indicate roi_3D_maintain=True. I indicate roi_position_axis=2 (NOTE: because there is no analysis_axis, in this case one must specify a roi_position_axis).\n",
    "Example 2. A timecourse is analysed. There are 20 timepoints. Each timepoint is a 512*512 2D image. The shape of the file is (20,512,512), thus the \"time dimension\" is in position 0 of the file's shape. I'm interested at a cell which moves, I am only interested at timepoints 10, 12 and 15. I want an independent measurement per each timepoint, for this reason I set analysis_axis=0. I draw ROIs at timepoints 10,12 and 15 and I save the collection as a .zip file. I indicate roi_3D_maintain as True (roi_3D_maintain=True). Because analysis_axis has been defined and it is the same as roi_position_axis I can leave roi_position_axis=None. NOTE: the analysis will be done on the whole image for all the timepoints except timepoints 10, 12 and 15, while it will be restricted to the respective ROIs for the 3 timepoints. One would then have to extract the interesting values from the results. This was just an example...\n",
